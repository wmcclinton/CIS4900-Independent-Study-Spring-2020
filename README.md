# CIS4900-Independent-Study-Spring-2020
This is the repository for my Independent Study Course during Spring 2020 semester. In this course I will be exploring the intersection of Program Synthesis and Machine Learning. In this repository I will keep documentation of my efforts including: Readings, Writings, and Projects done within the course. 

## Contents

### Readings
...Readings are broken up into 3 categories: **Future** (papers that I intend to read), **Present** (papers I am currently reading), and **Past** (papers I have read fully or skimmed). For the **Past** readings, 90% of them I've printed out a hard copy and have taken notes on; these tend to be the papers I have the most interest in.


### Writings
...This section conatins my Final Report for the Independent Study.

## What I've Learned
...In Progress (Alot will extend later: Methods in Program Sysnthesis [Sketch](https://people.csail.mit.edu/asolar/manual.pdf), [Pragmatics](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/pragmatics/), Deep Recurrent Networks for Sketch Classification and Generation, etc.)

## Future Directions
...In Progress

After months of literature review and preliminary testing our current direction is:

Natural Language Grounding Project:

1. Few Shot Classification Comparision against MAML (Going through Language)

2. Transfer Cartoon <-> Image (Ungrounded Arbitrary Vector) + NN and Vectors Grounded in Language (NN vs. Program)
___

3. Few Shot Transfer .... (Image to Drawing)

Pragmatics Project:

1. Finish Uninformed Listener

2. Run User Study Comparing Uninformed Listener vs. Pragmatic Listener

3. Publish
