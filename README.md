# CIS4900-Independent-Study-Spring-2020
This is the repository for my Independent Study Course during Spring 2020 semester. In this course I will be exploring the intersection of Program Synthesis and Machine Learning. In this repository I will keep documentation of my efforts including: Readings, Writings, and Projects done within the course. 

## Contents

### Readings
...Readings are broken up into 3 categories: **Future** (papers that I intend to read), **Present** (papers I am currently reading), and **Past** (papers I have read fully or skimmed). For the **Past** readings, 90% of them I've printed out a hard copy and have taken notes on; these tend to be the papers I have the most interest in.

### Projects
...This section contains personal projects that I've implemented within this course. ...

### Writings

## What I've Learned

## Future Directions
